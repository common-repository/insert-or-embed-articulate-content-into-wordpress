Quickly insert Articulate, Captivate, iSpring, Lectora, and more e-Learning content into a post or page.  Also compatible with Articulate Storyline, Articulate Rise, Adobe Captivate, Lectora, Camtasia, iSpring, Elucidat, Gomo, Obisidian Black, MindManager, or any other tool.

This plugin will add a new toolbar icon (the letter 'a') next to the 'Add Media' button on the Edit Post and Edit Page pages.  Upon clicking this icon, you will have the ability to upload your published Articulate, Captivate, Lectora, Camtasia, iSpring, Elucidat, Gomo, Obisidian Black, MindManager, or any other tool's content as a ZIP file.  Once uploaded, the plugin will automatically extract the content, find the appropriate .html file, and add code to your post or page that will display your Articulate content as an iframe.  Responsive IFrames, Lightbox, and other options like opening the content in a new window are included in the premium version.

If you're using WordPress's built-in Gutenberg editor, you'll see a new e-learning block.
